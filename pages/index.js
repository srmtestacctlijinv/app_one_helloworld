          <Typography>
            By library, we mean React provides helpful functions to build UI, but leaves it up to the developer where to use those functions in their application.
            Part of Reactâ€™s success is that it is relatively unopinionated about the other aspects of building applications. This has resulted in a flourishing ecosystem of third-party tools and solutions.
            It also means, however, that building a complete React application from the ground up requires some effort. Developers need to spend time configuring tools and reinventing solutions for common application requirements.
